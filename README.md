# KU Polls

A web application for conducting polls at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th).

# Background

Staff and students at KU frequently desire to conduct polls or surveys inside the university, or within a specific institution or organization. Polls and surveys are useful for making decisions, arranging events, and learning about other people's preferences and views, but they aren't absolutely necessary (like voting for a representative).


The most common poll/survey questions are multiple choice, where the poll taker selects a choice from a list of choices.


There are applications for this on the Internet, such as Google Forms and SurveyMonkey, but they all have limitations or unwanted features.
Google Forms is clumsy and a returning visitor cannot see his previously submitted choices, but he can submit new choices if the form settings are set to allow it. Google Forms do not have a setting for automatic start and end date; the form creator must manually enable/disable responses.

SurveyMonkey has limits on free forms, including the number of survey items and number of responses.
